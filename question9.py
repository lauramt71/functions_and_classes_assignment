"""
Write a function that takes a path to a directory as input and returns a list of all the immediate subdirectories within that
directory. Making use of the os library will be helpful here. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html for details. Some of the
built in os functions that may be helpful for this problem are os.listdir(), os.path.join(), os.path.isdir(), and os.getcwd(). For
example, there is a directory within this repository called test_dir. Within this directory there are 2 files called f1.txt and
f2.txt, and also a subdirectory called test_subdir. Given the path to test_dir (which will change depending on where in your
computer you downloaded the repository), the function should return the list ['test_subdir']. f1.txt and f2.txt are files, not
subdirectories. Return your list sorted in alphabetical order.
