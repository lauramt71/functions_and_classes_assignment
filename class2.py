If you have used Excel or some other spreadsheet program in the past you may be familiar with creating linear
trendlines of data. Given a series of points that lie on the XY plane, a trendline is a line that attempts to
model the relationship between the y values of the points and the x values of the points through the equation
y = mx + b. Whether this is actually a good fit or not depends on the data that is being looked at, but we are
going to create a class that takes in some data, creates a trendline based on the data that follows this equation,
and then create a score that tells us how well the trendline fits to our data. Notice that in this class there
is no __init__ method. There only needs to be one if there is code that needs to be run when an instance of the
class is initialized. Fill in the three methods below according to what they are supposed to do.

        This function takes 2 lists as inputs, X and Y. X is the x values of the datapoints and Y is the y values
        of the datapoints, so for example (X[1], Y[1]) would create the second datapoint in our dataset. This
        function should initialize 2 instance variables, self.m and self.b, where self.m is the slope of the
        trendline and self.b is the y intercept. See
